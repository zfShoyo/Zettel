Market Share - the percent of total sales in an industry generated by a certain company.
- company sales over period / total sales over period

This means that the percentage of an industry, the market share, is earned by a particular company over a period of time.

For example, if a company sold $100 million in tractors last year domestically, and the total amount of tractors sold in the U.S. was $200 million, the company's U.S. market share for tractors would be 50%.

The market share can be used to monitor the relative competitiveness of the company's products/services. If a company gorws its market share at the same rate as the total market is growing, that means its better than its competitors.

Companies can try to expand its share by lowering prices, advertising, introducing different products, or by appealing to differetn demographics.

market share is especially important in **cyclical industries**, and have less impact in **growth industries**. This is because **margins** tend to be low and operations run at maximum efficiency
