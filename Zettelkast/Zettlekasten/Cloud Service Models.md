# Cloud Service Models
The means in which CC can be serviced in. Some of the main ones include:
- [[SaaS]] -- a taxi, not paying for tolls or gas, you're just trying to get somewhere
- [[IaaS]] -- leasing a car and you are paying for it
- [[PaaS]] -- renting a car for vacation, doesn't need to be amazing/high specs, but you're still paying for it

The "aaS" here is "as a Service". It also means that it is
- shared
- has an hourly monthly subscription
- no contracts; so use it when you need it on demand
- self service; you can do it on your own, and its provisioned to you through automation
