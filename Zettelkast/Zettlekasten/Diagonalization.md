# Diagonalization
To take a square matrix and turn it into a diagonal matrix, which is a matrix having nonzero elements only in the diagonal running from the upper left to the lower right.

### Steps
1. Find the eigenvalues
2. Find n linearly independent eigen vectors of A
3. Construct **P*** by forming eigenbasis (P = eigenbasis), which is to just put the eigenvectors into one matrix
4. Construct **D** by putting eigenvectors into diagonal(D = Diagonal Matrix) and making everything else into 0's
5. $A=PDP^{-1}$
