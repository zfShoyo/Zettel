# Distance
The distance between two vectors v, u is defined to be $$||v-u|| = \sqrt{(v_{1} - u_{1})^2 + ... + (v_{n} - u_{n})^2}$$
Example:

u = $\bigg\{\begin{array}{rcl} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{array}\bigg\}$ and v = $\bigg\{\begin{array}{rcl} -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\bigg\}$

##### [[Orthogonal Projection]]:
Distance from Point P to a line L:
If *P is the endpoint of vector u* and *L passes through the origin* and in the same direction as v, the distance from P to L is $$dist(P,L) = ||u - Proj_{v}u||$$
