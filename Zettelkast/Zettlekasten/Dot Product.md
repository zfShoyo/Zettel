# Dot Product

We define the **Dot Product** of vectors **u** and **v** in $R^3$ by 

$$ u \cdot v = u_{1}v_{1} + u_{2}v_{2}  + ... u_{n}v_{n} $$

This is one of the fundamental ways to combine two vectors, and takes the sum of the products of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers.

#### Properties

**Dot product** is commutative, meaning $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$.

$u\cdot u = ||u||^2$ 

$||cu|| = |c|||u||$

(Pythagorean Theorem) $u \cdot v = 0$ if and only if $||u||^2 + ||v||^2 = ||u+v||^2$

(**Law of Cosines**) $u \cdot v = ||u|| * ||v||cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between vectors u and v.
