# IaaS
IaaS, or "Infrastructure as a Service", is the type of cloud computing service that offers the essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

This means that you can increase or decrease the amount of storage/compute you need (scalability). Imagine a small pipe / big pipe -- the more data you need to push simultaenously the more bandwith you need, so you pay for more pipe.

This is *your car*, meaning you are leasing the car and you are paying for it on your own. 

### Benefits:
- most flexible
- easy to automate deployment of storage/networking/processing power
- scalable
- clients retain complete control of infrastructure

### Limitations:
- Security is low - vulnerable to other [[Virtual Machines]]
- additional resources and training may be needed to manage infrastructure
- must have multi-tenant security to ensure customers cannot access data deposited by other customers

### Examples:
- AWS
- Azure
