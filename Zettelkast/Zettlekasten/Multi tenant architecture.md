# Multi tenant architecture
This refers to multiple cloud customers using shared computing resources, and although they share resourfes, the data is ikept totally separate. Without this,  [[IaaS]], [[PaaS]],  would all be less practical.

Single tenant vs multi-tenant is like a single family home vs living in apartment building.

Or like how multiple customers use the same bank, in the same location, but having completely different locations for assets.

### Benefits:
- lower costs
- effiecient resources
- increased computing capacity
- Simplified and streamlined

### Limitations:
- downtime
- security and compliance
- less customization

### Examples:
- Hubspot
- Github
- Salesforce
