# Null Space
The collection of vectors in which when you multiply with matrix A, you get the zero vector.
A**x**=0.

### How to find the null space
1. Make an augmented matrix with matrix A and 0's.
2. Put matrix into RREF
3. Solve system of equations with pivots on left side.
4. Factor out the free variables, and the vectors associated with them is the null space. (# of free columns = number of basis vectors = [[Dimension]](Null(A)))
