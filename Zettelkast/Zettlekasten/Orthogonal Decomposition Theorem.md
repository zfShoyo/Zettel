# Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem
The orthogonal decompoision to a vector y is the sum of a vector in the subspaec W of $R^{N}$ and a vector in the [[Orthogonal Complement]] ($W^{\bot}$) to W.


If W is a subspace of $R^{N}$, then each vector y in $R^{N}$ can be written in the form $$y = \hat y +z$$
where $\hat y$ is in W and z is in $W^{\bot}$  .

and $$z = y - \hat y$$
