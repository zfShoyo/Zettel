# Orthogonal Matrix
An nxn matrix is orthogonal if its n columns are orthonormal. 

### Properties:

For matrix Q, these properties are equivalent.
- Q is orthogonal
- $Q^{T}Q = I_{0}$
- Q is invertible with $Q^-1 -= Q^T$ 

Given P is also a matrix,
- PQ is also orthogonal
- $Q^-1$ is also orthogonal.
