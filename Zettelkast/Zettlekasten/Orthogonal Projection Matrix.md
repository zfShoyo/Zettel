# Orthogonal Projection Matrix
We use this to compute the projection of vectors onto another b vector without using the formal defintion of a projection.


$$P_{W} = C(C^{T}C)^{-1}C^T$$ where C is the [[Span]] put into one matrix.

#### Closet Vector Property
Let W be a subspace and u be a vector. Among all vectors in W,  the vector closest to u is the orthogonal projection $P_{W}u$ .
