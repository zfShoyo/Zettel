# Orthogonal Set
Basically, if every pair of distinct vectors are orthogonal to each other, then they are an othorgonal set.

### Theorem: 
Any orthogonal set of nonzero vectors is always linearly independent.

### Basis 
Orthogonal set + [[Basis]] = [[Orthogonal Basis]]
[[Orthonormal Sets]] + [[Basis]] = [[Orthonormal Basis]]

To check if an orthognal set is a basis, count the number of vectors in it.
