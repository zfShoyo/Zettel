# SaaS - Software as a Service
SaaS, or "Software as a Service", is a method of delivering software and applications over the internet via a subscription service, and is open to anyone. This means that users around the world manage and install these softwares on their own.

This is the *taxi*, meaning you're not paying for the tolls or the gas, you're just using it to get somewhere and leaving it.

This has the highest level of [[Abstraction]] compared to other models.
It has a [[Multi tenant architecture]].

### Examples: 
- Email services
- adobe cc
- MS office

### Benefits:
- low cost
- scalability, can provide different amounts depending on project
- access anywhere
- new versions updated on their own wihtout users needing to renew a license, which was how it was in traditional IT

### Limitations:
- lack of integration support 
- data security -- since large amounts of data are being passed through
- minimal customization
- lack of control --- taken by 3rd party service provider
- downtime -- for same reason as previous
