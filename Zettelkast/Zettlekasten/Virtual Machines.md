# Virtual Machines
Software based computers that can live independently of one another, but on the same physical system.

This means that you can run multiple os's on each physical system.

These are advantageous to run on [[Hypervisor | hypervisors]] because: 
- they are portable, meaning when one [[Host | host]] / hypervisor breaks down, you can instanlty switch it to another one, establishing a smaller *downtime*.
- cost saving to run multiple os's on one piece of infrastructure
- faster
