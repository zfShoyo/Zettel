# What is Cloud Computing
The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet, namely through a pay-as-you-use policy. This way, you don't have to build and maintain physical data centers and servers, and can just connect to a particular technology service that does this full-time.

Main cloud provider - AWS.
